Description: Yahtzee was developed for project 5 in ITEC 220 with Dr. Chase. 

Objective: Get the highest cumulative score based on the combinations and points added from the dice.

Directions: Roll the dice three time to obtain a certain combination or to gain the most points from the current turn. Each player will take turns rolling the dice up to three times and has the ability to hold any die's current value while rolling the rest. After the player obtains their desired combination or their three rolls are up, they must place the correct points in a given field. If no points obtained, the player must place a 0 in a field of choice. The game ends when all players have filled their cards.

Winner: the player with the highest cumulative score wins.
